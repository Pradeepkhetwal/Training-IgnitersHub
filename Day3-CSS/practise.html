    <!-- The main difference between inline and inline-block is that we can't set width and height of inline element but we can set width and height of inline-block element . And behave as inline in terms of taking space . 
    
    Note-: We can set height and width of only block and inline-block elements not the inline Element.
    
    When we set display as none the element is not visible and also does not take space , it becomes like it never existed.

    And when we write  visibility : hidden then the item is only hided the space occupied by it remains their but the element is not shown.
