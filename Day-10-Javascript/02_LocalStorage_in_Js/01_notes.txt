Local Storage is a built-in JavaScript feature that allows you to store key-value pairs on the browser side.

Data is stored persistently, meaning it doesn't expire and remains even if the browser is closed and reopened.

It's specific to the origin, meaning each website (or domain) has its own local storage, and data can't be accessed across domains.

We have a localstorage object that is provided by the browser.

All the key value pair of data stored can be checked by clicking on the inspect -> then-> Application -> localstorage.

So we have mainly 2 methods setItem() and getItem()  provided by the localStorage object to interact with Local Storage.

setItem(key, value)
Purpose: Used to store a key-value pair in the browser's local storage.
Syntax:
localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');


getItem(key)
Purpose: Used to retrieve the value stored in local storage associated with the given key.
Syntax:
let value = localStorage.getItem('key');
