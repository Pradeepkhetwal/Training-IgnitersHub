// Traditional way is simply check whether an image is clicked or not using event is this. But this is not a recomended approach to handle events.

// document.getElementById("owl").onclick = function () {
//   alert("owl clicked")
// }

// To work with events we must use event listeners which will listen to a specific type of event that we will mention or pass in it and then if that event occurs it will execute a callback function which is passed as an argumnent to the event listner.

// So using Event listner is a good practise.
